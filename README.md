# WebAssembly Coredump

> Monorepo for generating, parsing, debugging WebAssembly coredumps.

See [demo] for an overview about how to use Wasm coredumps.

## Debugging

> Think gdb for WebAssembly

See [wasmgdb] for documentation.

## Use Coredump today

Since no Wasm engine support exists today, you an use [wasm-coredump-rewriter] to inject Coredump
support.

## Coredump format

See [specificiation].

## Troubleshooting

### Running into stack overflow

Some Wasm binaries have very recursive flow of control, increase the maximum stack size:
```
$ ulimit -s 160000
```
